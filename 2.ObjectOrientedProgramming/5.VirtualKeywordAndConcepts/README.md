## What is a VTable?

A **vtable** is a data structure used in C++ to support dynamic (run-time) polymorphism. It acts as a lookup table that holds pointers to the virtual functions of a class. Each class with virtual functions will have its own vtable.
A vtable is not just a static structure; it plays a dynamic role during the execution of a program. When a class with virtual functions is created, the compiler generates a vtable at compile time. This table contains pointers to the class's virtual functions, allowing the program to resolve function calls at runtime based on the actual object type.
This mechanism is crucial in situations where different derived classes provide different implementations of a function, as it enables the appropriate function to be executed depending on the object's actual type, rather than the type of the pointer/reference used to call the function.

### Key Points:
- **Dynamic Dispatch**: The mechanism that selects which function to call at runtime based on the actual object type.
- **Efficiency**: Vtables enable polymorphism while maintaining performance, as the lookup for virtual functions is typically done through a simple pointer dereference.

## Why Use Virtual Functions?
Virtual functions promote a clean separation of interfaces and implementations, enhancing code maintainability and flexibility. By using virtual functions, you can define a base interface that all derived classes can implement in their own way, allowing for easier updates and modifications.
For example, if you add new derived classes, you don’t need to change the code that uses the base class interface, as long as the new classes adhere to the expected interface. This reduces coupling between components and adheres to the Open/Closed Principle in software design.

### Benefits of Virtual Functions:
1. **Polymorphism**: Virtual functions allow derived classes to override base class functions, enabling the same interface to be used for different data types.
2. **Resource Management**: By declaring a destructor as virtual, you ensure that the destructors of derived classes are called correctly, preventing resource leaks.

### Example:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        std::cout << "Base show\n";
    }
    virtual ~Base() {} // Virtual destructor
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        std::cout << "Derived show\n";
    }
};
```

## How VTables Are Created
The creation of a vtable happens behind the scenes during compilation. When the compiler encounters a class with virtual functions, it automatically generates a vtable for that class. Each entry in the vtable corresponds to a virtual function in the class, including overridden functions from derived classes.
This generation occurs regardless of whether the functions are explicitly defined in the derived class; if the derived class inherits a virtual function from the base class, it still has an entry in the vtable.

### VTable Structure:
- Each class with virtual functions has its own vtable.
- The vtable contains pointers to the virtual functions declared in that class.

### Example of VTable Creation:
For the `Base` and `Derived` classes:

```
+-------------------------+
| Base's VTable          |
+-------------------------+
| Base::show()           |
| Base::~Base()          |
+-------------------------+

+-------------------------+
| Derived's VTable       |
+-------------------------+
| Derived::show()        |
| Base::~Base()          |
+-------------------------+
```

## Object Instantiation
When you instantiate an object of a derived class, the constructor initializes the vptr (virtual pointer) to point to that derived class's vtable. This setup allows the program to call the correct function implementations based on the actual object type during runtime.
The vptr is typically set up by the constructor of the base class, which is called before the derived class's constructor. This ensures that the derived object is fully aware of its vtable before any function calls are made.

When you create an instance of a derived class, the memory layout looks like this:

```cpp
Base* obj = new Derived();
```

### Memory Layout:
- Each object of a class with virtual functions contains a pointer to its class’s vtable (often called `vptr`).

```
+-------------------+
|   Derived Object  |
+-------------------+
| vptr (points to   | --> +-------------------------+
| Derived's VTable) |     | Derived's VTable       |
|                   |     +-------------------------+
| other data        |     | Derived::show()        |
+-------------------+     | Base::~Base()          |
                          +-------------------------+
```

## Function Calls and Dynamic Dispatch
Dynamic dispatch allows C++ to determine which function to call at runtime rather than compile time. This capability is made possible through the use of the vptr and the associated vtable.
When a virtual function is invoked, the program does not rely on the compile-time type of the pointer or reference; instead, it looks up the correct function in the vtable based on the vptr of the actual object being pointed to. This mechanism ensures that the most derived version of the function is called, preserving the behavior expected from polymorphism.
When you call a virtual function through a base pointer:

```cpp
obj->show();
```

### Steps of Function Call:
1. Access the `vptr` from the `obj` pointer.
2. Retrieve the address of `Derived::show()` from the `Derived` vtable.
3. Call the `Derived::show()` function.

### Visualization of Function Call:
```
1. Access obj->vptr (points to Derived's VTable)
2. Retrieve Derived::show() from the vtable
3. Call Derived::show()

         +-------------------+
         |   Derived Object  |
         +-------------------+
         | vptr ------------->| --> +-------------------------+
         |                   |     | Derived's VTable       |
         +-------------------+     +-------------------------+
                                   | Derived::show()        |
                                   | Base::~Base()          |
                                   +-------------------------+
```

## Destructor Handling
Properly managing destructors in a hierarchy is vital for avoiding resource leaks. By declaring a destructor as virtual in the base class, you ensure that when an object of a derived class is deleted through a base class pointer, the correct destructor sequence is followed.
This means that the derived class's destructor is invoked first, allowing it to release any resources it holds, followed by the base class's destructor. If the destructor in the base class were not virtual, only the base class's destructor would be called, leading to incomplete cleanup and potential memory leaks.
When you delete the object:

```cpp
delete obj;
```

### Destructor Call Sequence:
1. The destructor for `Derived` is called first.
2. Then, the destructor for `Base` is called, ensuring proper cleanup.

### Visualization of Destructor Call:
```
1. Call Derived's destructor
2. Call Base's destructor

         +-------------------+
         |   Derived Object  |
         +-------------------+
         | vptr ------------->| --> +-------------------------+
         |                   |     | Derived's VTable       |
         +-------------------+     +-------------------------+
                                   | Derived::~Derived()     |
                                   +-------------------------+
                                   | Base::~Base()          |
                                   +-------------------------+
```
