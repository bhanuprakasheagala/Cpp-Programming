/*
Output:
func1()

NOTES:
Although the method `func2 ()`of class `Lazy` is only declared but not defined, the compiler
accepts the program. Because `func2`, a definition of the member function is not necessary.

This laziness of the instantiation process of member functions has two interesting properties.
1. Save Resources:
2. Partial Usage of Class Templates : You can instantiate class templates with template arguments
                                      that do not support all member functions.
                                      When you donâ€™t call those member functions, all is fine.
