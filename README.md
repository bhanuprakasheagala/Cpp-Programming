# Exploring C++ Programming
## Coding concepts and Language constructs

This Repo is intended to keep my learning progress on the topics of CPP. The main ideal for C++ Programming is to express concepts(ideas, notions, etc.) from a design directly in code.
#### Represent ideas, relationships among ideas in code
#### Represent independent ideas independently in code
#### Keep simple things simple without making complex things impossible.

### Template Programming
Templates are used for generic metaprogramming when a specific pattern or behaviour shall be provided to an arbitrary set of different types. 
Templates are used by the compiler as code generators to build type safe data containers.

Templates are parameter based. There are two parameter kinds allowed to be used for tem-plate implementations. The first kind is all kind of data types (structs, classes, standard types like chars). The second kind are non-type parameters. 
These are either constant integers (or enums values) or constant pointers to data or functions.

Based on the given parameters of an instantiated or called template, the compiler decides which variant of the template has to be compiled by replacing the template parameters with the provided types.

There are two kinds of templates. Function templates and class templates. Class templates can be used for structs, classes and unions.

A template is not a type, but only a pattern, that tells the compiler how to generate a type based on template parameters. 
That means that for each template, that is used with different template parameter types in the code, the compiler defines independent types, 
that consume independent memory resources.

### Simple Shell using CPP
This simple shell reads user input, splits it into arguments, and then forks a child process to execute the specified command. The execvp function is used to replace the child process's image with the specified command. The parent process waits for the child process to finish using waitpid.

### Abstract Types Demo
An abstract type is a type that completely insulates a user from implementation details. To do that, we decouple the interface from the representation and give up genuine local variables. Since we donâ€™t know anything about the representation of an abstract type (not even its size), we must allocate objects on the free store and access them through references or pointers.

### Count number of Bytes in a file
A simple version of wc that takes the command line option -c and outputs the number of bytes in a file.

About the line:
`std::vector<char> buffer((std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(file)), std::istreambuf_iterator<char>())`

1. `std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(file)`: This part creates an input iterator (std::istreambuf_iterator) for reading characters
    from the file. It's used to iterate over the contents of the file.
2. `std::istreambuf_iterator<char>()`: It's used as the ending iterator for the range.
    When used like this, it signifies the end of the stream. This explicitly specifies the type for the ending iterator. 
3. `std::vector<char>`: This is the type of the vector that we are creating. In this case, it's a vector of characters.

The entire line is essentially using the range constructor of std::vector. This constructor takes two iterators representing the
range to copy. In this case, it uses the iterators created from the file to copy the contents of the file into the vector.
So, the `buffer` vector is being initialized with the contents of the file, and the type of elements in the vector is `char`.
After this line, the `buffer` vector contains all the characters from the file, effectively representing the file content.

### I/O of User-Defined Types
In addition to the I/O of builtin types and standard `string`s, the `iostream` library allows programmers to define I/O for their own Types.
Here a `struct` type taken as simple example. Outputtuing is straightforward. The corresponding input operator is more complicated.

Note, The `is>>c` skips whitespace by default, but `is.get(c)` does not, so that this `Entry` - input operator ignores(skips) whitespace
outside the name string, but not within it.

### A DeskCalculator Example
This C++ code implements a simple calculator that can handle basic arithmetic expressions, variable assignments, and predefined constants. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

#### Token Definition:
The code defines an enumeration Kind to represent different types of tokens. Each token has a kind, and for certain tokens like numbers or names, there are additional fields to store relevant information.
#### Token Struct:
There is a Token struct that holds information about a particular token, including its kind, string value, and number value.
#### Error Handling:
There is a global variable noOfErrors to count the number of errors. The error function increments the error count, prints an error message, and returns a default value (1 in this case).
#### Symbol Table:
The code uses a std::map named table to store variable assignments, associating variable names with their values.
#### Token Stream Class:
The Token_stream class handles the input stream of tokens. It includes functions to get the next token, retrieve the current token, and set the input source. The destructor ensures proper cleanup.
#### Token Stream Implementation:
The implementation of Token_stream includes a get function that extracts the next token from the input stream based on the characters encountered. The switch statement categorizes characters into different token types.
#### Expression Parsing:
The code defines three functions for parsing expressions: expr, term, and prim. These functions collectively implement a recursive descent parser.
expr: Handles addition and subtraction operations.
term: Deals with multiplication and division operations.
prim: Represents the primary elements of an expression, such as numbers, variables, and parenthesized expressions.
calculate Function:
The calculate function repeatedly gets tokens from the stream and evaluates expressions until the end of the input is reached. It prints the result of each expression.
#### Main Function:
The main function sets up the calculator. It checks the command line arguments to determine the input source (either standard input or a string). It initializes the symbol table with constants (pi and e) and calls the calculate function.

#### Usage:
If no command line arguments are provided, the calculator reads expressions from standard input.
If one command line argument is provided, it is treated as a string, and the calculator reads expressions from that string.
If more than one command line argument is provided, an error is reported.

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and predefined constants. After evaluating each expression, the result is printed to the standard output. The program returns the number of errors encountered.
