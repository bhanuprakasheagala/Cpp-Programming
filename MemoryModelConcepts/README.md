## Default Allocator in C++

### Basics and Background Concepts

In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides a mechanism for managing dynamic memory allocation through the concept of allocators. An allocator is a class template that abstracts the details of memory allocation and deallocation for container classes such as `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map`, etc. The default allocator in C++ is `std::allocator`.

### Purpose of Allocators

Allocators serve several purposes:
1. **Encapsulation of Memory Management:** They encapsulate memory management details, allowing containers to manage their memory needs without depending on global new and delete.
2. **Customization:** Allocators allow customization of memory allocation strategies, which can be useful in scenarios with specific performance or memory usage requirements.

### Default Allocator (`std::allocator`)

The `std::allocator` is the default allocator used by the STL containers if no other allocator is specified. It is defined in the `<memory>` header.

### Key Components of `std::allocator`

The `std::allocator` class provides a set of type definitions and member functions that define how memory allocation and deallocation are performed. The key components include:

1. **Type Definitions:**
   - `value_type`: The type of objects that the allocator can allocate.
   - `pointer`, `const_pointer`, `reference`, `const_reference`: Pointer and reference types to `value_type`.
   - `size_type`: An unsigned integral type that represents the size of objects.
   - `difference_type`: A signed integral type that represents the difference between pointers.

2. **Member Functions:**
   - `allocate(size_type n)`: Allocates uninitialized storage for `n` objects of type `value_type`.
   - `deallocate(pointer p, size_type n)`: Deallocates the storage pointed to by `p`.
   - `construct(pointer p, Args&&... args)`: Constructs an object of type `value_type` in the allocated storage pointed to by `p` using placement new.
   - `destroy(pointer p)`: Destroys an object of type `value_type` pointed to by `p`.

### Programming Constructs in Detail

Here is a detailed breakdown of the key member functions of `std::allocator`:

#### 1. `allocate(size_type n)`

This function allocates uninitialized memory for `n` objects of type `value_type`. It returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

```cpp
pointer allocate(size_type n) {
    return static_cast<pointer>(::operator new(n * sizeof(value_type)));
}
```

#### 2. `deallocate(pointer p, size_type n)`

This function deallocates the memory previously allocated for `n` objects of type `value_type` at the pointer `p`.

```cpp
void deallocate(pointer p, size_type n) {
    ::operator delete(p);
}
```

#### 3. `construct(pointer p, Args&&... args)`

This function constructs an object of type `value_type` at the allocated memory location pointed to by `p`. It uses placement new to construct the object with the given arguments.

```cpp
template<typename... Args>
void construct(pointer p, Args&&... args) {
    ::new((void*)p) value_type(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```

#### 4. `destroy(pointer p)`

This function calls the destructor of the object of type `value_type` pointed to by `p`.

```cpp
void destroy(pointer p) {
    p->~value_type();
}
```
### How the Default Allocator Works in C++

The default allocator in C++, `std::allocator`, works by providing a standardized interface for memory allocation and deallocation, object construction, and destruction. Here's a detailed explanation of how it functions under the hood:

### 1. Memory Allocation

#### Allocation Process

When memory is needed for a container (e.g., adding a new element to a `std::vector`), the allocator's `allocate` function is called. This function is responsible for allocating a block of uninitialized memory that is large enough to hold a specified number of objects of the container's value type.

#### Implementation

The `allocate` function typically uses the global `operator new` to allocate the required memory. Here is a simplified implementation of the `allocate` function:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <cstddef> // for std::size_t

template<typename T>
class MyAllocator {
public:
    using value_type = T;

    MyAllocator() noexcept {} // Default constructor

    template<typename U>
    MyAllocator(const MyAllocator<U>&) noexcept {} // Copy constructor

    T* allocate(std::size_t n) {
        // Allocate memory for n objects of type T
        return static_cast<T*>(::operator new(n * sizeof(T)));
    }

    void deallocate(T* p, std::size_t n) noexcept {
        // Deallocate memory previously allocated for n objects of type T
        ::operator delete(p);
    }

    // Other necessary functions...
};
```

### 2. Memory Deallocation

#### Deallocation Process

When the memory is no longer needed (e.g., when an element is removed from a container or when the container is destroyed), the allocator's `deallocate` function is called to release the previously allocated memory.

#### Implementation

The `deallocate` function typically uses the global `operator delete` to free the memory. Here is a simplified implementation:

```cpp
void deallocate(T* p, std::size_t n) noexcept {
    // Deallocate memory previously allocated for n objects of type T
    ::operator delete(p);
}
```

### 3. Object Construction

#### Construction Process

After allocating memory, the allocator's `construct` function is used to construct objects in the allocated memory. This involves calling the constructor of the object with the specified arguments.

#### Implementation

The `construct` function uses placement new to construct an object at a given memory location. Here is a simplified implementation:

```cpp
template<typename... Args>
void construct(T* p, Args&&... args) {
    // Construct an object of type T at the allocated memory location p
    ::new((void*)p) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```

### 4. Object Destruction

#### Destruction Process

Before deallocating memory, the allocator's `destroy` function is called to destroy the objects in the allocated memory. This involves calling the destructor of the object.

#### Implementation

The `destroy` function calls the destructor of the object explicitly. Here is a simplified implementation:

```cpp
void destroy(T* p) {
    // Destroy the object of type T at the memory location p
    p->~T();
}
```

### Behind the Scenes

1. **Vector Initialization:**
   - When the `std::vector` is created, it initializes an internal allocator (`std::allocator<int>`).

2. **Adding Elements:**
   - When elements are added using `push_back`, the vector may need to allocate additional memory if the current capacity is insufficient.
   - The vector calls the allocator's `allocate` function to get a block of uninitialized memory.
   - The vector then calls the allocator's `construct` function to construct the new element in the allocated memory.

3. **Removing Elements or Destroying the Vector:**
   - When elements are removed or the vector is destroyed, the vector calls the allocator's `destroy` function to destroy the objects.
   - The vector then calls the allocator's `deallocate` function to release the memory.

### Summary

The default allocator in C++ (`std::allocator`) works by providing a consistent interface for memory management. It handles memory allocation and deallocation using the global `operator new` and `operator delete`, and it constructs and destroys objects using placement new and explicit destructor calls. This abstraction allows STL containers to manage their memory needs efficiently and flexibly, while also allowing developers to customize memory management strategies if needed.
